In Tailwind CSS, you can use utility classes to style the list style image of unordered lists. The list-image-[url(checkmark.png)] class you provided is not a default Tailwind CSS class, but it seems to be an example of a custom class that sets a specific image as the list style image.

Here's an explanation of the code you provided:

<ul class="list-image-[url(checkmark.png)] ...">: This line assigns the list-image-[url(checkmark.png)] class to the <ul> element. It appears to be a custom class that sets the list style image to a checkmark.png file. This class is likely defined in your Tailwind CSS configuration or as a custom CSS class in your project.

<li>5 cups chopped Porcini mushrooms</li>: This line represents a list item within the unordered list. The content of this list item is "5 cups chopped Porcini mushrooms".

The example you provided suggests that you have a custom class called list-image-[url(checkmark.png)] that applies a specific image as the list style image for the unordered list. The actual definition and styling of this custom class would need to be present in your project's CSS or Tailwind CSS configuration file.

To create a custom list style image in Tailwind CSS, you can define a CSS class that uses the list-style-image property and specify the URL of the desired image. For example:

html
Copy code
<ul class="list-custom-image">
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
In your CSS file or Tailwind CSS configuration, you would define the .list-custom-image class and set the list-style-image property to the URL of the desired image:

css
Copy code
.list-custom-image {
  list-style-image: url('path/to/custom-image.png');
}
Make sure to replace 'path/to/custom-image.png' with the actual path to your custom image file.

With this approach, you can customize the list style image by setting a specific image URL using the list-style-image property in your custom CSS or Tailwind CSS configuration.
