In Tailwind CSS, the display utility classes are used to control the display behavior of elements. They allow you to specify how elements are rendered and how they interact with other elements on the page. Here are the display classes available in Tailwind CSS along with their corresponding CSS properties:

display: block;
Renders an element as a block-level element, taking up the full width of its parent container.
inline-block:

display: inline-block;
Renders an element as an inline-level block element, allowing other elements to flow beside it while preserving block-level properties.
inline:

display: inline;
Renders an element as an inline-level element, allowing other elements to flow beside it without causing line breaks.
flex:

display: flex;
Turns an element into a flex container, allowing its children to be laid out in a flexible box model.
