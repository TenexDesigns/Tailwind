In Tailwind CSS, the clear property can be controlled using utility classes. The following classes correspond to their respective CSS properties:

clear-left corresponds to clear: left;
clear-right corresponds to clear: right;
clear-both corresponds to clear: both;
clear-none corresponds to clear: none;
You can use these classes in your HTML as follows:

<div class="clear-left">...</div>
<div class="clear-right">...</div>
<div class="clear-both">...</div>
<div class="clear-none">...</div>
In these examples, the clear property is applied to the div elements, which affects how they interact with floating elements.

clear-left means that the element will not move up adjacent to any element that is floated on the left.
clear-right means that the element will not move up adjacent to any element that is floated on the right.
clear-both means that the element will not move up adjacent to any element that is floated on either side.
clear-none means that the element can move up adjacent to another element regardless of whether it's floated or not.
You can also conditionally apply these classes in different states using variant modifiers. For example, use hover:clear-left to only apply the clear-left utility on hover:

<div class="clear-none hover:clear-left">...</div>
In this example, the div will not clear any floats by default, and will clear left floats when hovered.

In Tailwind CSS, the object-fit utility classes are used to control how an image or video is fitted within its container. The object-fit property specifies how the content of an element, such as an <img> or <video>, should be resized to fit its container. Here's how you can use the object-fit utility classes in Tailwind CSS:

Object Fit Classes:
Tailwind CSS provides utility classes for different object fit options: object-contain, object-cover, object-fill, object-none, and object-scale-down.
The object-contain class scales the content proportionally to fit inside the container, preserving its aspect ratio.
The object-cover class scales the content proportionally to cover the entire container, potentially cropping some parts of the content.
The object-fill class stretches the content to fill the entire container, potentially distorting its aspect ratio.
The object-none class displays the content at its original size, ignoring the container's dimensions.
The object-scale-down class scales the content down to fit inside the container if it is larger than the container, preserving its aspect ratio.
Example:

html
Copy code
<img class="object-contain" src="image.jpg" alt="Contained Image" />

<img class="object-cover" src="image.jpg" alt="Covered Image" />

<img class="object-fill" src="image.jpg" alt="Filled Image" />

<img class="object-none" src="image.jpg" alt="Original Size Image" />

<img class="object-scale-down" src="image.jpg" alt="Scaled Down Image" />
The object-fit utility classes in Tailwind CSS provide a convenient way to control how images and videos are fitted within their containers. You can use these classes to achieve different visual effects and maintain consistent aspect ratios based on your design requirements.
