The @apply directive in Tailwind CSS is used to extract component classes to avoid repeating the same utility classes over and over again. It helps to keep your HTML clean and easy to read. However, there are trade-offs to consider when using @apply.

Heres an example of how to use @apply:

.btn {
  @apply py-2 px-4 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded;
}
Now you can use this custom class in your components:

<button className="btn">Button</button>
However, excessive use of @apply can lead to whats known as "premature abstraction". This is when you try to abstract or simplify your code too early, which can lead to more complexity instead of less. Premature abstraction can make your code harder to understand and maintain, because it hides details that might be important to understand how the code works dev.to.

Furthermore, using @apply excessively can lead to large CSS files. This is because every class used with @apply gets marked as "used" by Tailwind and ends up being compiled into the stylesheet loaded on the page. So if you don't use those utility classes in the markup (and only in classes), they are essentially dead weight dev.to.

Instead of using @apply excessively, you might want to consider a different approach: "extracted components". This approach involves creating reusable components with their own styles. These components can then be used throughout your application, achieving the same goal of reducing repetition without the drawbacks of @apply.

For example, instead of creating a .btn class with @apply, you could create a <Button> component in Next.js:

// components/Button.js
export default function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button className="py-2 px-4 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded">
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
Now you can use this Button component anywhere in your application:

<Button>Click me</Button>
This approach gives you the benefits of code reuse and clean HTML without the drawbacks of @apply. Its also more in line with the "component-based" philosophy of React and Next.js dev.to.





FOLLOW UP--QUESTION -------> How do I get accesof the click event of the button in the above context
**********************************************************************************************


To access the click event of the button, you can pass an onClick prop to the Button component. This prop should be a function that will be called when the button is clicked. Inside the Button component, you can attach this function to the button's onClick event handler.

Here is how you can modify your Button component:

// components/Button.js
export default function Button({ children, onClick }) {
  return (
    <button 
      className="py-2 px-4 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded"
      onClick={onClick}  // Attach the onClick function to the button's onClick event
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
Now when you use the Button component, you can pass a function to the onClick prop:

<Button onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked!')}>Click me</Button>
In this example, when the button is clicked, it will log 'Button clicked!' to the console. You can replace the console.log function with any function you want to execute when the button is clicked upmostly.com, blog.logrocket.com.

To access the click event of the button in the Button component, you can pass a click event handler as a prop and attach it to the button element. Heres an example of how you can achieve this:

jsx
Copy code
export default function Button({ children, onClick }) {
  const handleClick = () => {
    if (onClick) {
      onClick();
    }
  };

  return (
    <button className="py-2 px-4 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded" onClick={handleClick}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
In the updated code, a new prop onClick is added to the Button component. When the button is clicked, the handleClick function is invoked, which checks if onClick is defined and then calls the provided click event handler.

Now, you can use the Button component and pass an onClick function as a prop to handle the click event:

jsx
Copy code
<Button onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked!')}>Click me</Button>
In the example above, when the button is clicked, it will log 'Button clicked!' to the console.

By adding the onClick prop to the Button component and attaching it to the button element as an onClick event listener, you can easily handle the click event and perform any desired actions or logic in response to the button click.
