line-clamp-none:

You can apply these utility classes directly to the HTML elements that contain text to limit the number of visible lines. For example:

html
Copy code
<div class="line-clamp-3">
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error.</p>
</div>
In this example, the line-clamp-3 class is applied to the div element to restrict the text within three lines.

These "line-clamp" utility classes in Tailwind CSS provide a convenient way to control the number of visible lines for text content, allowing you to create elegant and space-efficient layouts.
