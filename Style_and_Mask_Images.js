To style images in Tailwind CSS, you can use utility classes to modify various aspects of the image, such as size, borders, shadows, and more. Here's an example of how you can style images in Tailwind CSS:

html
Copy code
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" class="w-64 h-64 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
In the example above, the w-64 class sets the width of the image to 64 units (e.g., pixels), the h-64 class sets the height of the image to 64 units, the rounded-lg class adds rounded corners to the image, and the shadow-lg class adds a shadow effect.

Tailwind CSS provides many utility classes to control the appearance and behavior of images. You can adjust the width and height using responsive classes like w-[100px] or h-[10rem]. You can also apply additional styling such as borders, filters, positioning, and more using the available utility classes.

As for image masking in Tailwind CSS, you can achieve this effect using CSS masking properties. However, Tailwind CSS does not have specific utility classes for image masking. To apply image masking, you can define custom CSS classes and use the mask-image or clip-path property directly in your CSS or inline styles.

Heres an example of applying image masking with CSS properties:

html
Copy code
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" class="mask-image">
css
Copy code
.mask-image {
  -webkit-mask-image: url('mask.png');
  mask-image: url('mask.png');
}
In the example above, the mask-image class applies a mask to the image using the mask-image property. You can provide the URL of the mask image in the url('mask.png') value.

By defining custom CSS classes or using inline styles, you can apply various image masking techniques in Tailwind CSS based on your specific requirements.
