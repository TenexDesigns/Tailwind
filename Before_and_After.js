In Tailwind CSS, the before: and after: utilities are used to control the content of the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements respectively.

The ::before and ::after pseudo-elements in CSS are used to insert content before or after the content of an element. These pseudo-elements are inline by default and can be manipulated in various ways, such as changing their content, display type, position, and more.

Here's an example of using the before: and after: utilities in Tailwind:

<a class="before:content-['Hello'] before:text-red-500 after:content-['World'] after:text-blue-500"> </a>
In this example, the ::before pseudo-element of the anchor tag is given the content 'Hello' and the text color red, while the ::after pseudo-element is given the content 'World' and the text color blue. This means 'Hello' will appear before the content of the anchor tag in red and 'World' will appear after the content in blue.

Note: The before: and after: utilities require the JIT mode to be enabled in your Tailwind CSS configuration tailwindcss.com, stackoverflow.com.
