Tailwind CSS uses a mobile-first design approach. This means that by default, styles are applied to all screen sizes, and then modified for larger screens as needed. Here's how it works:

Unprefixed Utilities: These are utilities without any prefix like sm: or md:. For example, uppercase. These utilities apply to all screen sizes.
<div class="uppercase">
  <!-- This text will be uppercase on all screen sizes -->
</div>
Prefixed Utilities: These utilities start with a prefix like sm:, md:, lg:, etc. They apply only at the specified breakpoint and above. For example, md:uppercase applies only on medium screens and larger.
<div class="md:uppercase">
  <!-- This text will be uppercase on medium screens and larger -->
</div>
Targeting Mobile Screens: To style for mobile screens, use the unprefixed version of a utility. The sm: prefix does not mean "on small screens," but rather "at the small breakpoint."
<!-- This will center text on mobile, and left align it on screens 640px and wider -->
<div class="text-center sm:text-left"></div>
Targeting a Breakpoint Range: If you want to apply a utility only when a specific breakpoint range is active, stack a responsive modifier like md with a max-* modifier.
<!-- This will apply flex layout at the md breakpoint and up to (but not including) the xl breakpoint -->
<div class="md:max-xl:flex">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
Targeting a Single Breakpoint: To target a single breakpoint, stack a responsive modifier like md with the max-* modifier for the next breakpoint.
<!-- This will apply flex layout only at the md breakpoint -->
<div class="md:max-lg:flex">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
The idea here is to start with mobile styles first, and then add or override styles for larger screens. This approach can make it easier to build responsive designs.
