In Tailwind CSS, the peer class and peer-* modifiers allow you to style an element based on the state of a sibling element. This is useful when you want to apply styles based on the state of another element that shares the same parent.

Here's an example:

<form>
  <label class="block">
    <span class="block text-sm font-medium text-slate-700">Email</span>
    <input type="email" class="peer ..."/>
    <p class="mt-2 invisible peer-invalid:visible text-pink-600 text-sm">
    Please provide a valid email address.
  </p>
  </label>
</form>
In this example, the paragraph with the warning message has the class peer-invalid:visible. This means that the paragraph will switch from invisible to visible when the sibling input field is in an invalid state, i.e., when the email address entered in the input field is not valid. This pattern works with every pseudo-class modifier, for example, peer-focus, peer-required, and peer-disabled.

Note that the peer marker can only be used on previous siblings due to how the general sibling combinator works in CSS.

Moreover, you can differentiate between multiple peers by giving each peer a unique name using a peer/{name} class, and include that name in modifiers using classes like peer-checked/{name}.

<fieldset>
  <legend>Published status</legend>

  <input id="draft" class="peer/draft" type="radio" name="status" checked />
  <label for="draft" class="peer-checked/draft:text-sky-500">Draft</label>

  <input id="published" class="peer/published" type="radio" name="status" />
  <label for="published" class="peer-checked/published:text-sky-500">Published</label>

  <div class="hidden peer-checked/draft:block">Drafts are only visible to administrators.</div>
  <div class="hidden peer-checked/published:block">Your post will be publicly visible on your site.</div>
</fieldset>
In this example, there are two peers: peer/draft and peer/published. Depending on which radio button is checked, the corresponding div will switch from hidden to block, making it visible. The labels for the radio buttons also change color based on which radio button is checked tailwindcss.com.

In Tailwind CSS, the concept of "peers" allows you to style an element based on the state of a sibling element without using JavaScript. It enables you to create dynamic styling based on the relationship between elements in the DOM.

Styling Based on Sibling State (peer-{modifier}):
To style an element based on the state of a sibling element, you can mark the sibling element with the peer class and use the peer-* modifiers to target and style the target element. For example, you can use peer-invalid to style an error message based on the state of an input field:
html
Copy code
<form>
  <label class="block">
    <span class="block text-sm font-medium text-slate-700">Email</span>
    <input type="email" class="peer ..." />
    <p class="mt-2 invisible peer-invalid:visible text-pink-600 text-sm">
      Please provide a valid email address.
    </p>
  </label>
</form>
In the above example, the peer class is applied to the input field, and the peer-invalid:visible class is applied to the error message. When the input field is marked as invalid (e.g., through JavaScript validation), the error message becomes visible (visible class) based on the presence of the peer-invalid class on the input field.

This pattern can be applied with various pseudo-class modifiers like peer-focus, peer-required, or peer-disabled, allowing you to style elements based on the state of their sibling peers.

Differentiating Peers:
When using multiple peers, you can differentiate them by giving each peer a unique name using the peer/{name} class. This allows you to style an element based on the state of a specific peer by including that name in the modifiers. For example:
html
Copy code
<fieldset>
  <legend>Published status</legend>

  <input id="draft" class="peer/draft" type="radio" name="status" checked />
  <label for="draft" class="peer-checked/draft:text-sky-500">Draft</label>

  <input id="published" class="peer/published" type="radio" name="status" />
  <label for="published" class="peer-checked/published:text-sky-500">Published</label>

  <div class="hidden peer-checked/draft:block">Drafts are only visible to administrators.</div>
  <div class="hidden peer-checked/published:block">Your post will be publicly visible on your site.</div>
</fieldset>
In this example, the peer/draft and peer/published classes are applied to the radio buttons. The labels are styled differently based on the checked state of each radio button using peer-checked/{name} classes (peer-checked/draft:text-sky-500 and peer-checked/published:text-sky-500). Additionally, the corresponding descriptions are shown or hidden based on the checked state of each radio button using peer-checked/{name}:block classes.

You can name your peers however you like directly in your markup, and Tailwind CSS will generate the necessary CSS to apply the specified styles.

By leveraging peers and differentiating them through naming, you can create dynamic and contextual styling based on the state and relationship of sibling elements in the DOM. This allows for more flexible and powerful styling options without relying on JavaScript.
