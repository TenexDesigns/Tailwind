In Tailwind CSS, the z-index utility classes are used to control the stacking order of elements on a web page. The z-index property specifies the stacking order of positioned elements, determining which elements appear in front of or behind others. Here are the z-index utility classes in Tailwind CSS:

z-{n}:

z-index: {n};
Sets the z-index value to a specific number {n}.
z-auto:

z-index: auto;
Allows the browser to determine the stacking order automatically.
z-0:

z-index: 0;
Sets the z-index value to 0.
z-10, z-20, z-30, ..., z-90:

z-index: 10, z-index: 20, z-index: 30, ..., z-index: 90.
Sets the z-index value to a specific increment of 10.
z-100, z-200, z-300, ..., z-900:

z-index: 100, z-index: 200, z-index: 300, ..., z-index: 900.
Sets the z-index value to a specific increment of 100.
Example:

html
Copy code
<div class="z-10">Element with z-index of 10</div>

<div class="z-50">Element with z-index of 50</div>

<div class="z-100">Element with z-index of 100</div>

<div class="z-1000">Element with z-index of 1000</div>

<div class="z-auto">Element with auto z-index</div>
By using these utility classes, you can easily control the stacking order of elements without writing custom CSS. The higher the z-index value, the closer an element will appear to the front. The z-auto class allows the browser to determine the stacking order automatically based on the element's position in the HTML document.

Its important to note that z-index only applies to positioned elements (elements with a position value of relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky). Additionally, the z-index property only affects elements within the same stacking context. Elements in different stacking contexts, such as positioned elements with a higher z-index value, will always appear on top of elements in lower stacking contexts, regardless of their z-index values.

  In Tailwind CSS, the z-index property is controlled using the z-{index} utilities. The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element. An element with a greater stack order is always in front of another element with a lower stack order.

Here are some examples of z-index classes in Tailwind:

z-0 sets z-index: 0;
z-10 sets z-index: 10;
z-20 sets z-index: 20;
z-30 sets z-index: 30;
z-40 sets z-index: 40;
z-50 sets z-index: 50;
z-auto sets z-index: auto;
You can use these classes in your HTML like this:

<div class="z-40 ...">05</div>
<div class="z-30 ...">04</div>
<div class="z-20 ...">03</div>
<div class="z-10 ...">02</div>
<div class="z-0 ...">01</div>
In this example, the div with z-40 will appear on top of all the others, because it has the highest z-index.

Remember, z-index only works on positioned elements (relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky). If an element is not positioned, z-index will not have any effect.
