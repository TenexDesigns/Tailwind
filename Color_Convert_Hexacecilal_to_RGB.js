To convert a hexadecimal color code to its RGB equivalent, you can follow these steps:

Split the hexadecimal color code into three pairs of two characters each, representing the red, green, and blue components. For example, the color code #36B37E can be split into 36, B3, and 7E.

Convert each pair from hexadecimal to decimal. In hexadecimal, each digit can range from 0 to F, which corresponds to decimal values from 0 to 15. You can use the following conversion table:

Hexadecimal	Decimal
0	0
1	1
2	2
3	3
4	4
5	5
6	6
7	7
8	8
9	9
A	10
B	11
C	12
D	13
E	14
F	15
Using this table, you can convert 36 to 54, B3 to 179, and 7E to 126.

Combine the decimal values for the red, green, and blue components, respectively, to form the RGB notation. In this case, the RGB notation would be rgb(54, 179, 126).

So, the conversion from #36B37E to rgb(54, 179, 126) involves splitting the hexadecimal code into three pairs, converting each pair to decimal, and combining the decimal values into the RGB notation.
