Interactivity in Tailwind CSS
Interactivity in Tailwind CSS is achieved using different utilities that control various aspects of user interaction with the UI. These utilities include Accent Color, Appearance, Cursor, Caret Color, Pointer Events, Resize, Scroll Behavior, Scroll Margin, Scroll Padding, Scroll Snap Align, Scroll Snap Stop, Scroll Snap Type, Touch Action, User Select, and Will Change.

Accent Color
As of Tailwind CSS v2.2.16, there's no built-in utility for controlling the accent color. However, you can customize your color palette by editing theme.colors or theme.extend.colors in your tailwind.config.js file.

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'regal-blue': '#243c5a',
      },
    }
  }
}
Appearance
Tailwind CSS provides the appearance-none utility to remove the default styling of form controls. It's useful when you want to apply custom styles to inputs, buttons, and other form elements.

<input class="appearance-none" type="text">
Cursor
The cursor utility in Tailwind CSS is used to control the appearance of the cursor when hovering over an element. For instance, cursor-pointer changes the cursor to a pointer when hovering over the element.

<button class="cursor-pointer">Click me</button>
Caret Color
The caret color utilities in Tailwind allow you to control the color of the text input cursor. You can use caret-{color} to change the color of the text input cursor. Tailwind also lets you conditionally apply utility classes in different states using variant modifiers, like focus:caret-indigo-500 to apply the caret-indigo-500 utility on focus tailwindcss.com.

<textarea class="caret-blue-500 focus:caret-indigo-500"></textarea>
Pointer Events
Pointer events utilities in Tailwind CSS control whether an element can be the target of pointer events tailwindcss.com. With pointer-events-auto, the element can trigger events like click or hover, while with pointer-events-none, the element ignores such events.

<div class="pointer-events-none focus:pointer-events-auto">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
Resize
The resize utility in Tailwind CSS is used to specify whether an element should be resizable by the user, and along which axes. For instance, resize-y allows the element to be resized vertically.

<div class="resize-y">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
Scroll Behavior
The scroll behavior utilities control the scrolling behavior of the container. For example, scroll-smooth makes the container scroll smoothly tailwindcss.com.

<html class="scroll-smooth hover:scroll-auto">
  <!-- ... -->
</html>
Scroll Margin
Scroll margin utilities in Tailwind CSS control the scroll offset around items in a snap container tailwindcss.com. The scroll-m-8 utility, for example, sets the scroll margin to 2rem.

<div class="scroll-m-8 hover:scroll-m-0">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
Scroll Padding
Scroll padding utilities are similar to scroll margin utilities, but they control the scroll padding instead of the scroll margin. They can be used in the same way as scroll margin utilities, like scroll-p-8 to set the scroll padding to 2rem.

<div class="scroll-p-8 hover:scroll-p-0">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
Scroll Snap Align
The scroll snap align utility is used to control where an element snaps within a scroll container when scrolling stops.

<div class="scroll-snap-start">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
Scroll Snap Stop
The scroll snap stop utility controls whether the browser should always stop the scrolling at the start of the snap target, regardless of how fast the user is scrolling.

<div class="scroll-snap-stop-always">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
Scroll Snap Type
Scroll snap type utilities determine the type of snapping behavior that should be applied to a scroll container. For example, scroll-snap-x mandatory makes the container snap along the x-axis.

<div class="scroll-snap-x mandatory">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
Touch Action
The touch action utility in Tailwind CSS controls how the browser responds to touch events on an element. For instance, touch-action-none prevents the browser from handling any touch actions.

<div class="touch-action```
