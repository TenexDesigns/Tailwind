In the CSS code you provided, 100% refers to the ending point of the gradient color stop in the linear-gradient background property.

Let's break down the background property:

Copy code
background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(252, 252, 252, 0.60) 0%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.60) 100%);
linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(252, 252, 252, 0.60) 0%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.60) 100%) sets the background to a linear gradient that transitions from one color to another.

180deg specifies the direction of the gradient, which is from top to bottom (180 degrees).

rgba(252, 252, 252, 0.60) represents the starting color of the gradient. It uses the RGBA color model, with the RGB values (252, 252, 252) for a light color and an alpha value of 0.60 for transparency.

0% indicates the starting point of the gradient color stop, which is at the top.

rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.60) represents the ending color of the gradient, which is a slightly different shade of white with the same transparency value.

100% indicates the ending point of the gradient color stop, which is at the bottom. This means that the gradient transition occurs throughout the entire height of the element.

The 100% in this context specifies that the ending color stop of the gradient is at the bottom of the element, creating a smooth transition from the starting color to the ending color.

The linear-gradient background property allows you to create gradients that transition between colors in a linear fashion, providing depth and visual interest to elements.
