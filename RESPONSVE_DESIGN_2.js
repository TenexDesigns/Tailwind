Sure, lets take a look at how to use breakpoints in Tailwind CSS to create responsive designs, and how to avoid excessive work with them, illustrated with code examples.

Tailwind CSS provides five default breakpoints:

sm: 640px
md: 768px
lg: 1024px
xl: 1280px
2xl: 1536px
To apply a style only at a certain breakpoint, you prefix the utility with the breakpoint name followed by the : character. For example:

<div class="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
    This text will change size at each breakpoint.
</div>
In this example, the text-sm class applies by default (for mobile), and as the screen size increases, the text size increases at each breakpoint.

However, its not practical or necessary to apply all these breakpoints to every element. Here are some ways to avoid excessive work:

1. Start with a mobile-first approach:

By default, Tailwind uses a mobile-first breakpoint system, meaning that unprefixed utilities (like text-sm) take effect on all screen sizes, 
    then you can add styles for larger screens as needed. This can help minimize the amount of code you need to write.

<div class="text-sm md:text-lg">
    This text will be `text-sm` on mobile and `text-lg` on medium screens and up.
</div>
2. Extract reusable styles into components:

If you find yourself repeating the same group of utility classes, you can extract them into a component using Tailwind's @apply directive. This can help you keep your HTML clean and make your styles easier to manage.

@layer components {
  .btn {
    @apply px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-md;
    @apply md:px-6 md:py-3 md:text-lg;
  }
}
Then in your HTML, you can use the .btn class for any button:

<button class="btn">Click me</button>
This button will have different padding and text size at the md breakpoint, and you can reuse this class across your application without having to reapply these styles each time dev.to, tailwindcss.com, v2.tailwindcss.com.
