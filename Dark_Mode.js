To configure light mode and dark mode in Tailwind CSS, you can use the dark variant to add styles that will only apply when dark mode is enabled.

Here are the steps you can follow:

Enable dark mode in your Tailwind CSS configuration file: Open your tailwind.config.js file and set the darkMode option to 'class'.
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class', // This enables dark mode
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
Add dark mode styles: You can now use the dark: variant to style elements for dark mode. The dark: variant is used in the same way as responsive variants like sm: and md:.
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-black text-black dark:text-white">
  This div will have a white background and black text in light mode, 
  and a black background and white text in dark mode.
</div>
Toggle dark mode: To toggle dark mode, you need to add or remove the dark class from the html or body element in your HTML. You can do this with JavaScript. Here's an example using vanilla JavaScript:
// This function toggles dark mode
function toggleDarkMode() {
  document.documentElement.classList.toggle('dark');
}
You can call this function when a user clicks a button or a switch to toggle dark mode.

<button onclick="toggleDarkMode()">Toggle Dark Mode</button>
Remember to store the users preference (e.g., in local storage) so you can apply it when the user revisits your site lannonbr.com, .

  To configure light mode and dark mode using Tailwind CSS, you can leverage the built-in dark mode support provided by Tailwind CSS. Here are the steps to set up and configure light and dark mode for your site:

Install Tailwind CSS: If you havent already, install Tailwind CSS into your project. You can use a package manager like npm or yarn to install it. Here's an example using npm:

shell
Copy code
npm install tailwindcss
Configure Tailwind CSS: Create a Tailwind CSS configuration file (tailwind.config.js) if you dont have one already. In this file, you can customize the color palette and other theme settings. Make sure to enable the dark mode variant by setting the darkMode property to 'class':

js
Copy code
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class', // Enable dark mode variant
  theme: {
    extend: {
      // Customize your theme settings
    },
  },
  // Other configuration options
};
Create CSS classes for light and dark mode: In your HTML markup, you can use the dark class to indicate that an element should have styles specific to dark mode. You can define custom utility classes in your CSS to apply different styles based on the presence of the dark class.

html
Copy code
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900">
  <h1 class="text-black dark:text-white">Welcome to my site</h1>
  <!-- Content goes here -->
</div>
In this example, the background color and text color change depending on whether the dark class is applied to the parent element.

Toggle dark mode with JavaScript: You can add JavaScript code to toggle the dark mode based on user preference or other conditions. Heres an example using JavaScript:

js
Copy code
// Add an event listener to toggle dark mode
document.getElementById('toggle-dark-mode').addEventListener('click', function () {
  document.documentElement.classList.toggle('dark');
});
In this example, clicking on an element with the toggle-dark-mode id will toggle the dark class on the documentElement, which affects the styling of elements with the dark class.

Add dark mode styles to your CSS: In your CSS file, you can define styles specific to dark mode using the dark selector. These styles will be applied when the dark class is present.

css
Copy code
.dark .bg-white {
  background-color: #1f2937;
}

.dark .text-black {
  color: #f9fafb;
}
In this example, the background color and text color are customized for dark mode using the .dark selector.

By following these steps, you can configure light mode and dark mode for your site using Tailwind CSS. Customize the color palette and add specific styles for light and dark modes to create a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
