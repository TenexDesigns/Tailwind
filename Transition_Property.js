To use the transition property in Tailwind CSS, you can follow these steps:

1. Controlling transitioned properties:

Use the transition-{properties} utilities to specify which properties should transition when they change. For example, you can use transition-colors to transition the color property.
Here's an example of using the transition utility on a button element to transition the background color and transform properties on hover:
<button class="transition ease-in-out duration-300 bg-blue-500 hover:-translate-y-1 hover:scale-110 hover:bg-indigo-500">
  Save Changes
</button>
2. Hover, focus, and other states:

Tailwind CSS allows you to conditionally apply utility classes in different states using variant modifiers. For example, you can use hover:transition-all to only apply the transition-all utility on hover.
Here's an example of applying the transition-all utility on hover:
<div class="hover:transition-all">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
3. Customizing your theme:

By default, Tailwind provides transition-property utilities for seven common property combinations. You can customize these values by editing theme.transitionProperty or theme.extend.transitionProperty in your tailwind.config.js file.
Here's an example of customizing the transition property for the height and spacing properties:
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      transitionProperty: {
        'height': 'height',
        'spacing': 'margin, padding',
      }
    }
  }
}
You can find more information about customizing the default theme in the theme customization documentation.

These steps should help you use the transition property in Tailwind CSS. For more details and examples, you can refer to the official Tailwind CSS documentation on transition-property and transition-delay.
