The difference in naming styles between "black-normal" and "white" in the provided context is due to the way Tailwind CSS handles color names.

In Tailwind CSS, color names that consist of multiple words or have special characters (such as spaces, hyphens, or uppercase letters) need to be enclosed in quotation marks to indicate that they are a single string value. This is required to differentiate them from Tailwind CSS color utility classes, which are typically single words or abbreviated.

In the given configuration, "black-normal" includes a hyphen, so it is enclosed in quotation marks to indicate that it is a single string representing the color name. On the other hand, "white" is a single word without any special characters, so it does not require quotation marks.

Heres a comparison:

"black-normal": This naming style is used for colors that have special characters or multiple words. The quotation marks are necessary to denote it as a single string representing the color name.

white: This naming style is used for colors that are single words without any special characters. Quotation marks are not needed in this case.

Tailwind CSS understands both naming styles and treats them appropriately when generating the final CSS output.
