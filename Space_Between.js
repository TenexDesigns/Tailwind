Add horizontal space between children
Control the horizontal space between elements using the space-x-{amount} utilities.

01
02
03
<div class="flex space-x-4 ...">
  <div>01</div>
  <div>02</div>
  <div>03</div>
</div>
​
Add vertical space between children
Control the vertical space between elements using the space-y-{amount} utilities.

01
02
03
<div class="flex flex-col space-y-4 ...">
  <div>01</div>
  <div>02</div>
  <div>03</div>
</div>
​
Reversing children order
If your elements are in reverse order (using say flex-row-reverse or flex-col-reverse), use the space-x-reverse or space-y-reverse utilities to ensure the space is added to the correct side of each element.

01
02
03
<div class="flex flex-row-reverse space-x-4 space-x-reverse ...">
  <div>01</div>
  <div>02</div>
  <div>03</div>
</div>
​
Using negative values
To use a negative space value, prefix the class name with a dash to convert it to a negative value.

<div class="flex -space-x-4 ...">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
​
Limitations
These utilities are really just a shortcut for adding margin to all-but-the-first-item in a group, and aren’t designed to handle complex cases like grids, layouts that wrap, or situations where the children are rendered in a complex custom order rather than their natural DOM order.

For those situations, it’s better to use the gap utilities when possible, or add margin to every element with a matching negative margin on the parent:

<div class="flow-root">
  <div class="-m-2 flex flex-wrap">
    <div class="m-2 ..."></div>
    <div class="m-2 ..."></div>
    <div class="m-2 ..."></div>
  </div>
</div>

In Tailwind CSS, space-between can be achieved by using the 'space-x-{amount}' or 'space-y-{amount}' classes on a container element. It automatically adds a defined margin to the direct children of the container. The {amount} corresponds to values in the default spacing/sizing scale set by Tailwind CSS.

Heres an example of how you can use the space-x-{amount} property:

<div class="flex space-x-4">
  <div>01</div>
  <div>02</div>
  <div>03</div>
</div>
Here, horizontal space of 4 units is added between the direct children elements.

You can also use the 'space-y-{amount}' to add vertical space between elements:

<div class="space-y-4">
  <div>01</div>
  <div>02</div>
  <div>03</div>
</div>
In this case, vertical space of 4 units is added between the direct children elements.

These utilities work well when your elements are all in one line (for space-x) or in one column (for space-y).

However, they have certain limitations:

If the elements wrap onto new lines, the space does not get applied between rows or between wrapped items. For that kind of a scenario, consider using margin m-{amount} or padding p-{amount} instead.
They cannot be used to add space between text nodes or other inline elements that are not block or flex containers. For example, if you try to use space-x on a <p> tag to add space between the words, the utility will have no effect.
To solve these problems, you might have to resort to individual padding or margin styling, or opt for a different layout strategy.

That being said, when used correctly, the space-x and space-y utilities are powerful tools that can simplify your layout design process by automatically handling spacing between direct children. They are great for grids, buttons groups, stacks, and more.
