In Tailwind CSS, you can use utility classes to control white space handling within HTML elements. Here are the utility classes for white space:

whitespace-normal:
CSS Property: white-space: normal;
Description: Sets the white space handling to normal, allowing the text to wrap and break according to the specified width.
Example:



....

html
Copy code
<p class="whitespace-normal">This text will wrap and break according to the width of its container.</p>
In this example, the whitespace-normal class is applied to the <p> element, and the text will wrap and break normally.

whitespace-nowrap:
CSS Property: white-space: nowrap;
Description: Prevents the text from wrapping to the next line, causing it to appear on a single line without any line breaks.
Example:

html
Copy code
<p class="whitespace-nowrap">This text will appear on a single line without any line breaks.</p>
In this example, the whitespace-nowrap class is applied to the <p> element, and the text will not wrap to the next line.

whitespace-pre:
CSS Property: white-space: pre;
Description: Preserves the white space within the element, including line breaks and multiple spaces, exactly as it appears in the HTML source code.
Example:

html
Copy code
<pre class="whitespace-pre">   This text will preserve     all white spaces, including line breaks.   </pre>
In this example, the whitespace-pre class is applied to the <pre> element, and the text will preserve all white spaces, including line breaks and multiple spaces.

You can apply these utility classes directly to HTML elements to control the white space handling. For example:

html
Copy code
<p class="whitespace-normal">This text will wrap and break according to the width of its container.</p>
<p class="whitespace-nowrap">This text will appear on a single line without any line breaks.</p>
<pre class="whitespace-pre">   This text will preserve     all white spaces, including line breaks.   </pre>
In this example, each element has a different white space handling based on the applied utility class.

These utility classes for white space handling in Tailwind CSS provide flexibility in controlling how white spaces, line breaks, and text wrapping behave within HTML elements.
