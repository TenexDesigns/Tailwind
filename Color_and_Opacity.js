To declare the color with an opacity of 14%, you can use the RGBA color notation in CSS. RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha, where the alpha channel represents the opacity. Here's an example of declaring the color with an opacity of 14%:

css
Copy code
background-color: rgba(54, 179, 126, 0.14);
In this example:

54 represents the red value in the RGB color model.
179 represents the green value.
126 represents the blue value.
0.14 represents the alpha value, which denotes the opacity.
Using the rgba() notation, you can specify the opacity directly as a decimal value between 0 and 1. In this case, 0.14 represents 14% opacity, where 0 is fully transparent, and 1 is fully opaque.

Note that the rgba() notation allows you to apply the desired opacity to any valid RGB color, so you can adjust the red, green, and blue values to achieve the desired color while maintaining the 14% opacity.
