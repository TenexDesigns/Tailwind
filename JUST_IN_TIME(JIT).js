Just-In-Time (JIT) mode is a feature introduced in Tailwind CSS v2.1+. It's an on-demand engine that generates your styles as you author your templates instead of generating all possible styles at initial build time dev.to.

The main advantage of JIT mode is the performance improvement. It significantly reduces the size of the generated CSS by only including the styles that are actually used in your markup, resulting in smaller, faster-loading stylesheets tio.ist.

In addition to the performance benefits, JIT mode also provides better development experience with features like arbitrary value support, responsive variants, pseudo-classes like first-letter and first-line, and many others dev.to, tio.ist.

In summary, JIT mode in Tailwind CSS is a mode that generates styles as they are needed, providing both performance benefits and a better development experience.

  In the context of Tailwind CSS, "JIT" stands for "Just-In-Time" mode. It is a feature introduced in Tailwind CSS v2.1.0 that provides on-demand generation of CSS classes.

In traditional CSS frameworks, all classes are pre-generated and included in the final CSS file, which can result in a large file size even if only a fraction of those classes are used in the HTML markup. This approach can lead to increased file size and slower loading times.

JIT mode in Tailwind CSS changes this by dynamically generating CSS classes based on the utility classes used in your HTML markup. It analyzes your HTML and generates only the necessary CSS classes required to style the elements on the page. This process happens on-the-fly, or just-in-time, during the build process.

The benefits of JIT mode include:

Reduced file size: Only the necessary CSS classes are generated, resulting in a smaller CSS file size.
Improved performance: Smaller CSS files load faster, improving the overall page load speed.
Dynamic utility classes: You can use dynamic classes like bg-red-500 or text-indigo-700 without having to manually configure them in the configuration file.
To use JIT mode in Tailwind CSS, you need to enable it in your configuration file (tailwind.config.js). Set the mode option to 'jit':

js
Copy code
module.exports = {
  mode: 'jit',
  // Other configuration options
};
By enabling JIT mode, you can take advantage of the dynamic CSS class generation provided by Tailwind CSS, resulting in more efficient and optimized stylesheets for your web application.
